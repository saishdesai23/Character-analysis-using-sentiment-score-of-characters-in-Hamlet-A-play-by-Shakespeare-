# Sentiment-Analysis

This project involves studying characters in a play and analysing their characteristics using the Vader Sentiment Analyser. We extract dialogues of all characters in a play and quantify there characteritics using sentiments scores associated with their dialogues. For calculating the sentiment score for each character we make use of the VADER sentiment analyzer. (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)
